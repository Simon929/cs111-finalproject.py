# cs111 finalproject.py

This project creates a statistical models of text which quantifies how similar one piece of text is to another.
To achieve this, we are asked to consider following features:

1 the distribution of word lengths in a document – calculating the frequency of words of length one, length two, length three, etc.

2 the distribution of words used by an author – calculating the frequency of each unique word.

3 the distribution of word stems used (e.g., “spam” and “spamming” would have the same stem) by an author – calculating the frequency of each unique stem.

4 the distribution of sentence lengths used by an author – calculating the frequency of sentences with one word, two words, three words, etc.
